Please navigate to the `notebook` subfolder for a description of the notebooks and folders. You can run our analysis notebooks using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with the steps below. 

## Running the notebooks with Docker

This is based on:
* [Jupyter Docker Stacks documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Docker Stacks GitHub page](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks)

**Note:** For the following steps, please use the terminal and navigate to the `notebook` subfolder. 

### Build a Docker Image with Dependencies

Run the following command to build a Docker image with the name `jupyter/my-datascience-notebook`:

```
docker build --rm -t jupyter/my-datascience-notebook .
```

### Run a Docker container

Run the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 10000:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/my-datascience-notebook
```

Once running, enter http://localhost:10000/ in your browser and use the token displayed in the terminal. You can then access the notebooks in the `work` folder. 

**Note:** The port has been set to `10000` (`10000:8888`).
